See [PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Run the project

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

> NOTE: This doesn't currently work with `npm run dev` because of some building issues.

### Comments

The demo is extremely basic at this point and doesn't fully implement all aspects. For example, the latest block hash isn't used yet, but it should be fairly trivial to add.

None of the code is clean or optimized, and the `Send` page needs to be opened before going to the `Receive` one for now.
